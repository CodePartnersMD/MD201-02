### Coding Project Rubric

Following is how we will grade your coding assignments

Total of 50 points are possible if you meet all criteria

If are not prepared to present there will be 10 points deducted leaving a possible total of 40/50 points

Warning: you can always resubmit for full credit if the assignment is turned in on time but if your first submission is past the due date you can only receive a total of 40 possible points.

### Makeup Policy

We are willing to work with students who are falling behind but we require you to proceed with the following steps:

1. reach out to us on slack and inform us of what you are struggling with
2. Ensure you have regular commit history so we can observe your progress
3. come in during open office hours from 1 hour before class for additional instruction
3. Keep your trello board up to date so we can see where you are at in your sprint 

We cannot be held accountable for students who do not follow these steps.  We want to see you succeed but you are responsible for your own learning.
