# Code 201: Foundations of Software Development

## Week 5 - 6: Build a Vote Tracker

### Overview
In this week the students will start a new project that is based on tracking click events in a browser window, doing mathematical calculations based on the number of clicks on each individual item, and ultimately display a chart of click data. In addition, use of local storage to preserve the click data over screen introduces the students to the concept of persistence.

The overall goal for this week is to have this project finished by the end of Class 12, so that the last two classes can be spent on auxiliary advanced topics and also the transition into Project Week. So, as with Salmon Cookies, the first two or three days are intense, and then the intensity dissipates.

### Week 5-6 Learning Objectives
As a result of completing the third week of Code 201, students will be able to:
* Display random images contained in an image directory and track user clicks on those images, as measured by successful completion of the weekly code project.
* Discern which distinct items on a web document are being clicked or otherwise interacted with by the user, as measured by successful completion of the weekly code project.
* Utilize a 3rd-party JavaScript charting library, in our case ChartJS, to display data graphically in a web document, as measured by successful completion of the weekly code project.
* Store and retrieve used click data in the browserâ€™s local storage, as measured by successful completion of the weekly code project.
