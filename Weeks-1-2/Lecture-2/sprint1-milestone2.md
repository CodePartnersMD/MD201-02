# Assignment Overview: Lab 2

For this lab we will be adding a few things to the work we've done so far. Use the User Stories and the Technical Requirements to make a plan for how to proceed. Assume that all user stories from the previous lab carry over, except for the ones that are modified or are superseded here.

It can be very handy to take notes and sketch things out when you are planning your projects and the code within it.

### User Stories (MVP... what you must do as a minimum)

- As a developer, I want to use thoughtful and descriptive console.log() throughout my code to help test my work and assist with debugging.
- As a developer, I want to gather information from my users and display it on the web page
- As a developer, I want to consider the user experience (UX) of my About Me and guessing game, trying to view it through the eyes of a user. Wait... maybe I should just write a user story for that...
- As an end user of the About Me and guessing game, I want to answer quetions that will create a profile about me.
- As a prospective job seeker, I want to consider adopting additional features that I have seen in the 'About Me' projects made by others, so that my 'About Me' can become more thorough and interesting than my original conception.
- As a prospective job seeker, I want to make myself more personable by adding a Top Ten list to the bottom of my About Me page with an ordered list in HTML, for instance, my Top Ten Favorite Movies or my Top Ten Places I Want to Visit, or something along those lines.
- As a prospective job seeker, I was to use CSS to creatively and tastefully style and layout my page.
- As a prospective job seeker, I want to have five yes/no questions in my "about me" guessing game so that I have enough questions to cover a variety of things about me.



### Technical Requirements
- Ensure you have 6-7 questions display to the user, they can be confirm or prompt
- store those users in variables and concatenate them in some way
- display the stored answers into HTML

### Technical Stretch Goals 
- create an array with multiple string values
- create another prompt question that will act like a CAPTCHA for the user to verify they are human
- randomly generate one of the values in the array to display to the user
- verify that the user's input matches the displayed value (might be a good place for a loop) if it does, proceed to the page, otherwise throw an alert with an error message

### Submitting Your Assignment

-Ensure you are working on on a new branch of your repo with the name of this lab i.e. lab-02, for this assignment
-Once you complete the assignment, ACP your code to the current branch
-Submit this assignment with a link to your repo.
