### Week 1 & 2 Learning Objectives
As a result of completing Week 1 of Code 201, and the “About Me” page with an interactive guessing game weekly project, students will:
* apply their knowledge of flow control structures in JavaScript to construct a guessing game website in which its code passes a linter and works in the manner intended by the student and specified in the course assignment
* be able to explain the difference between ID and class tags in HTML, and how each is used in order to style their website with industry-proper CSS code
* be able to work smoothly in the command line and with Git in order to apply project organization and version control to a code project in a manner that aligns with professional standards and practices
* be able to summarize the overall structure of a HTML document and demonstrate the functions of each part, as measured by quizzes administered in Canvas
* demonstrate understanding of arrays as a fundamental data structure by utilizing arrays in their weekly code project, as directed in the course assignments, and also as measured by quizzes administered in Canvas
* demonstrate conceptual and practical understanding of JavaScript functions, and how to pass input to and return output from functions, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignments and quizzes administered in Canvas
* demonstrate conceptual understanding of the fundamentals of CSS layout, including the box model as absolute, relative, fixed, and float techniques, as measured by quizzes administered in Canvas
* demonstrate the ability to successfully style HTML documents with CSS including lists, colors, and text organization, as measured by successful completion of the weekly code assignment
* demonstrate the ability to successfully interlink multiple HTML dents within a project, or link to external HTML documents, using the anchor tag in HTML (the <a> tag)
