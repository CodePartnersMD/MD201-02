# Code 201: Foundations of Software Development

### Week 3 & 4 Learning Objectives
As a result of completing Week 2 of Code 201, and building the retail chain weekly project, students will:
* Demonstrate the ability to construct a web application of multiple pages that serves a collection of user stories and technical goals outlined in the assignment documents.
* Be able to explain and demonstrate how object-oriented (OO) programming is valuable for writing DRY code that is more maintainable, easier to extend, and easier to debug,  and also how OOP differs from other forms of programming, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
* Be able to appropriately use OO design to create a single constructor function that generates multiple objects representing the individual store locations required for the retail chain, and also provides a means of generating new objects based on data submitted in a HTML form.
* Be able to write code to model relationships between objects at a basic level, in order to effectively create representations of real-world entities in code and solve the associated real-world problems.
* Refine and then extend their understanding of CSS layout techniques to include grid systems.
